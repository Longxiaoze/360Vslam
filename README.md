# VSLAM System for 360-Degree Panoramic Cameras

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) system based on a 360-degree panoramic camera. The system is built upon [stella_slam](https://github.com/stella-cv/stella_vslam) and utilizes the insta360 X4 panoramic camera. VSLAM is a technology that uses visual information to enable robots or devices to localize themselves and build maps in unknown environments. It is widely used in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and augmented reality.

## Features
- **Panoramic Vision Support**: Captures comprehensive environmental information using a 360-degree panoramic camera.
- **Real-Time Localization**: Achieves high-precision real-time localization through visual feature matching and optimization algorithms.
- **Map Construction**: Generates sparse 3D environmental maps.
- **Map Reuse**: Supports relocalization using prior maps created with panoramic or other cameras.
- **Modular Design**: The system adopts a modular architecture for easy extension and maintenance.

## Dependencies
- **Programming Languages**: C++

- **Hardware Requirements**:
    - 360-degree panoramic camera insta360 X4
